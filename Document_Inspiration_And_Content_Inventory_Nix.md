I think this site does a pretty good job of keeping the user in mind with hover-over options that let the user see chords as they scroll down. The mobile version of the website tries to push getting the app, so in some sense, its inconvenient as the user has no quick access to the chords in the song, but the app seems to be more where their efforts would be focused anyways, so I guess it’s somewhat fair. I’d also say that some buttons, like the “Simplify” button, are vague and don’t tell the user what they do.

I like how they use the mint green color, it’s nice and gives every page a connected theme. At times, it is a bit overpowering, so I would have wanted the white to hold it back a little more. Some of the text doesn’t quite line up correctly, which is disorienting. This isn’t helped by the copious amounts of formations on the page. I think it’s interesting and definitely shows that the designer of the page had a lot of ideas, but it feels like there’s never a uniform look to it.

I also sort of like the way they’ve used color, but I feel they could have sped up some of the animations, like the one where the text and pictures come into view as you scroll down. It causes me to stop if I want to see what it is and wastes some of the user’s time. The pictures on the page seem to bring in most of the visual interest, so I do also agree with enlarging them to show them off.

# Paragraphs About Myself

I’m Parker Nix, a second-year undergrad student in the IDM program. I do wish we could have been in person this term, but safety comes first. Either way, I’ve been eager to start this class because I have been pretty curious about the coding side of websites. Designing is always good, but I think if I get a hang of this part too, I’ll feel a bit more confident if I wanted to do a job that required making a site.

Aside from this, I also play the Violin. I’ve been playing for about ten years now and I was even in a major for it in middle school (It was a public school, but they had a program where you’d go to the school for a specific art major). I used to think I’d want to have a career in music, but I pretty quickly changed my mind because there are so many other options and it just didn’t feel like the right choice for me somehow. Still, I love playing and I’m currently in Drexel’s orchestra, which has been a great place to keep working on getting better.

In high school, I also was part of an arts program, under the film major. I did find some enjoyment in cinematography and editing and all, but again, it just didn’t feel like my thing. My brother is going to Drexel too, and he’s in the film program here. He’s definitely much better with all that stuff than I am, but I at least know my way around a few of the Adobe programs and I can probably(?) get a good shot or two.

As for experience with coding, I can’t say I have too much. I’ve messed around with it here and there, but I still feel really new to the whole thing. My dad did some studying with a few books and some other resources, so he’s also showed me a few things. We also had a few lessons about it in our film program (at some point it became the “Film and New Media” major, but I was a senior at that point), but to be quite honest I don’t remember much about it other than that we were using processing.
