    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m Parker Nix, a second-year undergrad student in the IDM program. I do wish we could have been in person this term, but safety comes first. Either way, I’ve been eager to start this class because I have been pretty curious about the coding side of websites. Designing is always good, but I think if I get a hang of this part too, I’ll feel a bit more confident if I wanted to do a job that required making a site.

        <br>Aside from this, I also play the Violin. I’ve been playing for about ten years now and I was even in a major for it in middle school (It was a public school, but they had a program where you’d go to the school for a specific art major). I used to think I’d want to have a career in music, but I pretty quickly changed my mind because there are so many other options and it just didn’t feel like the right choice for me somehow. Still, I love playing and I’m currently in Drexel’s orchestra, which has been a great place to keep working on getting better.
        
        <br>In high school, I also was part of an arts program, under the film major. I did find some enjoyment in cinematography and editing and all, but again, it just didn’t feel like my thing. My brother is going to Drexel too, and he’s in the film program here. He’s definitely much better with all that stuff than I am, but I at least know my way around a few of the Adobe programs and I can probably(?) get a good shot or two.
        
        <br>As for experience with coding, I can’t say I have too much. I’ve messed around with it here and there, but I still feel really new to the whole thing. My dad did some studying with a few books and some other resources, so he’s also showed me a few things. We also had a few lessons about it in our film program (at some point it became the “Film and New Media” major, but I was a senior at that point), but to be quite honest I don’t remember much about it other than that we were using processing.</p>
